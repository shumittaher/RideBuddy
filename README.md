## About the Project

TThis web app addresses a socio-economic problem in Bangladesh, where I reside. In the capital city, Dhaka, many schools provide a bus service. However, most parents are unable to rely on the city's public transportation system to be safe or timely enough for their children's daily commute to and from school.

The app aims to solve this issue by creating a platform for carpooling among students from the same school who live in the same residential area. This solution not only helps reduce the stress of parents who do not own a car but also offers a safer alternative to public transport. Additionally, it benefits the city by reducing the number of cars on the road, contributing to less traffic and lower emissions.

## Distinctiveness and Complexity

This webapp is catered to a specfic issue related to Dhaka city in Bangladesh.
the app utilizes 5 different models other than the Django built-in model for users. they are as follows:

1. Locations: This model is to store individual embarcation and disembarcation locations. Their type, as in, whether it is a school or a residential area, as well as other optional directional information about that location. This table is not editable by the common user of the app. It is meant to be edited from the admin module.

2. Trips: this is to be used
